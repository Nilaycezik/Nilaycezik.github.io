                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">Everything is in change. Technology has now infiltrated every part of our
                    lives. Even while sending my writing to you, I use technology. Technology is always there when you
                    sleep at night, get up all through the day, cook, and drive. So, what exactly is this new
                    technology? What impact did it have on us?</p>

                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">The history of technology precedes the history of humanity. 3.3 million
                    years ago, the first tools appeared. In Kenya’s Lake Turkana, these tools big, shapeless stones used
                    as knives. Since it precedes the history of humans, people believe that it used by an ancestor such
                    as Australopithecus used . The earliest known fire was found 1 million years ago. The account of how
                    fire was discovered is still a mystery. After then, humanity began on the Neolithic Revolution. This
                    occurred between 20000 and 15000 years ago.
                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">People started to make clay, pottery, and bricks during this time period.
                    In addition, throughout this
                    time period, humans began to construct clothes out of woven materials to suit their clothing needs.
                    The
                    earliest irrigation system developed in Egypt’s Nile river region about BC 6000. Metal superseded
                    bronze
                    about 1200 BC, and iron manufacturing began. About quest of a life-extension cure, alchemists
                    created
                    gunpowder in 850 BC. Windmills, compasses, mechanical clocks, steam engines, railroads, pictures,
                    telegraphs, telephones, electric lights, vehicles, radios, aircraft, TVs, computers, transistors,
                    the
                    internet, and artificial intelligence all added to this list later.</p>

                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">
                <h2>Create New Things</h2></p>
                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">Throughout history, people have always interested and have created new
                    things. However, they unwittingly grow hooked to the product they create. To provide a basic
                    example, computer games have an addictive influence on the majority of us. While waiting for the
                    bus, most of us pass the time by playing video games. Addiction to video games, like substance
                    addiction, is harmful to our health.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">Another example is how vital mobile phones are in our life. In fact,
                    numerous studies have shown that cell phones are more addictive than nicotine. Everyone should take
                    time to reflect on their own lives. How many hours can we go without looking at our phones, or how
                    many minutes do we feel compelled to glance at them? Banking transactions, shopping, and other
                    activities may now be done entirely over the phone, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence.
                    As individuals get used to eating and living a sedentary lifestyle, the path prepared for various
                    ailments and the human lifetime decreased. To put it another way, as we grow more hooked, our
                    average life expectancy decreases.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">
                <h2>To Sum Up</h2></p>


                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">If we look at it from a different perspective, we can see that as
                    technology advances, so do the instruments in the area of medicine. So, despite this progress, why
                    is average lifespan lowering? Because illnesses will continue to knock on our door as a result of
                    our sedentary lifestyle and excessive consumption, even if medicine develops.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-50 mb-4">Of course, we should take use of new technology when they develop. Because
                    technology’s importance in today’s world is evident. Despite this, it is best to use everything in
                    moderation.
